# Solutions for Section 1
## Introducing TensorFlow.js and Machine Learning

These are the solutions for Section 1 of the **Machine Learning in JavaScript with TensorFlow.js** course. See [solutions index](../README.md) for solutions to other sections.


### Lab: TensorFlow Playground

This is an open lab - an opportunity for you to experiment. As such, there are no strict right and wrong answers.

However, the following links show possible solutions to the suggestions in the lab:

1. Regression model requiring minimal epochs to train
2. XOR (Exclusive Or) model
3. Spiral model

Each link will open a model configuration in the TensorFlow Playground. You can push the play button to watch the training process for the model.
