## ISection 3: TensorFlow.js Core Concepts

These are the solutions for Section 3 of the **Machine Learning in JavaScript with TensorFlow.js** course. See [solutions index](../../README.md) for solutions to other sections.

### Lab: Install and run TensorFlow.js in the browser

#### Exercise 1

See [exercise1.html](./exercise1.html).
 
I have included examples for all the suggestions listed in the exercise, but there are is always more to try! If you are struggling with this please keep playing with Tensor creation and the math functions until you feel you understand.

#### Exercise 2

See [exercise2.html](./exercise2.html).

#### Exercise 3

See [exercise3.html](./exercise3.html).

#### Exercise 4

See [exercise4.html](./exercise4.html).

The previous exercise solutions also include memory management with <code>tf.tidy(...)</code> to ensure that no tensors are left in memory.
