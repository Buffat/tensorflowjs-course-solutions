# Solutions for Section 5
## Defining a Model in TensorFlow.js

These are the solutions for Section 5 of the **Machine Learning in JavaScript with TensorFlow.js** course. See [solutions index](../../README.md) for solutions to other sections.


### Lab: Creating a Model

This is the second lab for the Linear Regression project which is developed through sections 4 - 7.

The starting point to this lab is the [solution for the section 4 lab](../4-data-prep/README.md).

At the end of this lab, your code should look similar to [linear-section-5-checkpoint.html](./linear-section-5-checkpoint.html).
