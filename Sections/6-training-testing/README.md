# Solutions for Section 6
## Defining a Model in TensorFlow.js

These are the solutions for Section 6 of the **Machine Learning in JavaScript with TensorFlow.js** course. See [solutions index](../../README.md) for solutions to other sections.


### Lab: Creating a Model

This is the third lab for the Linear Regression project which is developed through sections 4 - 7.

The starting point to this lab is the [solution for the section 5 lab](../5-model/README.md).

At the end of this lab, your code should look similar to [linear-section-6-checkpoint.html](./linear-section-6-checkpoint.html).
