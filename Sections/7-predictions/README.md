# Solutions for Section 7
## TensorFlow.js Prediction

These are the solutions for Section 7 of the **Machine Learning in JavaScript with TensorFlow.js** course. See [solutions index](../../README.md) for solutions to other sections.


### Lab: TensorFlow.js predictions

This is the final lab for the Linear Regression project which is developed through sections 4 - 7.

The starting point to this lab is the [solution for the section 6 lab](../6-model/README.md).

At the end of this lab, your code should look similar to [linear-section-7.html](./linear-section-7-final.html).

### Lab: Beyond Linear Regression

The starting point to this lab is the solution to the previous lab, [linear-section-7.html](./linear-section-7-final.html).

At the end of this lab, your code should look similar to [linear-section-7-beyond.html](./linear-section-7-beyond.html).
