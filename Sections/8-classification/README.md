# Solutions for Section 8
## Binary Classification

These are the solutions for Section 8 of the **Machine Learning in JavaScript with TensorFlow.js** course. See [solutions index](../../README.md) for solutions to other sections.

### Lab: TensorFlow.js Binary Classification

This is a new project (Binary Classification), but it builds on the code for the previous project (Linear Regression). 
The starting point to this lab is the [solution for the section 7 lab](../7-predictions/README.md).

At the end of this lab, your code should look similar to [binary-section-8.html](./binary-section-8.html).
