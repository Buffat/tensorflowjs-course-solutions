# Solutions for Section 9
## Multi-class Classification

These are the solutions for Section 9 of the **Machine Learning in JavaScript with TensorFlow.js** course. See [solutions index](../../README.md) for solutions to other sections.

### Lab: TensorFlow.js Multi-class Classification

This is a new project (Multi-class Classification), but it builds on the code for the previous project (Binary Classification). 
The starting point to this lab is the [solution for the section 8 lab](../8-classification/README.md).

At the end of this lab, your code should look similar to [multi-section-9.html](./multi-section-9.html).
